# HelloVaccine backend

A subscription-based portal which will send you mails when the vaccine would be available.

Install:

1. Run _npm install_ to install all dependencies.
2. Run _npm start_ to run the Node server at port 5000.

### Note: The CoWIN API allows only 20 searches within 15 minutes. I was not sure how to solve this.

Please star the repo if it helps in any way!
